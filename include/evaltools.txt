what needs to be done for evaluation:


config for the solver:
    precision, discount parameters, 
    heuristic specification
    trajectory - when to end

config for the MDP:
    init lower & upper bound
    init lower upper for terminal bound if SSP

what needs to be optimized:
    trajectory end criterion:
        can't use brtdp, have to figure out another way

        limiting depth seems like an ok fast idea?
        limit depth + brtdp criterion


OPTIMIZATION DIRECTION for every objective
how to figure out bounds ? make them part of the solver as well ~ implicitly ; set to max reward which kind of sucks

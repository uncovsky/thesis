legend:
	the numbers denote the treasure values received on entering the given state
	# - empty space, can swim through
	* - seabed, impossible to move into ( actions that hit a wall are not allowed )

the environment is deterministic, but random noise can be included

the two benchmarks that were included:
	a) treasure-convex
	b) treasure-concave

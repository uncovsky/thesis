this is an adapted version of the classic racetrack benchmark

legend:
	s - initial state 
	x - wall, on hit the car is returned to the initial state and its velocity is
						set to zero
	g - goal states, can hit at any speed and the race is over ( no more fuel or
									 time penalties)

The three maps that were used:
	a) racetrack-easy
	b) racetrack-ring
	c) racetrack-hard
